# Handwash-Detection-System
Implemented an Android application using Android Studio and Java that allows hospital administration to monitor effective hand washing by nursing staff for minimum 20 sec duration ( COVID-19 handwash guideline ).

The images have been scrapped from internet and the project right now only differentiates between a handwash and wash basin.

Android Studio files will be added soon
